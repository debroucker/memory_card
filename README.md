# Memory Card

This project is the game of Memory Card. 

I did it in 2020, during my 3th year of university license. This is a school project, and is developed in JavaScript and Ajax. This project is finished.

## Rules
You must discover a couple of card.

If the two cards turned over are the same height (example : two kings) or the same color (♣ or ♠ or ♥ or ♦) then, the two cards stay turned over.

Else, the two cards are delivered figure not visible.
